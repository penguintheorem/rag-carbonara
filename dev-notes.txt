 To obtain a creamy sauce while making a carbonara, use fresh eggs and finely grated cheese, such as Pecorino Romano or Parmesan. Combine the eggs and cheese off the heat to create a smooth emulsion that coats the pasta. Ensure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs gently without scrambling them.

 Answer: To obtain a creamy sauce in carbonara, combine raw eggs with the fat rendered from guanciale and a splash of starchy pasta cooking water. Stir these ingredients vigorously off the stove with the hot cooked pasta to create a luxurious creamy texture. No cream is needed, as the egg and fat mixture achieves the desired richness.
